# Holiday Plans Management (Buzzvel Test)

* This project was created with the aim of developing a small website for managing holiday plans. The interface, although simplistic, meets the need well, and some UI/UX techniques were also applied to improve certain points of the experience.

* Technologies used 💻
  * Vite <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vitejs/vitejs-original.svg">
  * React <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original.svg">
  * Chakra UI <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/190887639-d0ba4ec9-ddbe-45dd-bea1-4db83846503e.png">
  * TypeScript <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" max-width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg">
  * Cypress <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/cypressio/cypressio-original.svg">
  * Axios <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/axios/axios-plain.svg">

* The choice of Vite as the development environment for the project is due to the performance gain at build time, as well as the recommendation of the React.dev documentation itself, among other benefits.
* The tests carried out were end-to-end tests, which aim to test both the back and the front of the system.
* How to run the application? 🏃
  * Just run a command <strong color="black">npm run dev</strong>, since the package manager used was npm <img align="center" alt="JoseNeto-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/npm/npm-original-wordmark.svg">
  * In this case, it would be a way of shelving the front end. Here is the directory containing the information needed to run the back end.
